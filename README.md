# String details
For this exercise we'll build a simple program for the analysis of an input string and add new features, that we'll implement by adding new methods.

Use one (or more) new methods for each new requirement

## The basics
* Declare the Scanner object in the main method and pass it to each method that needs to query for input.
* Create a method that asks the user to input a text and prints it back to the user
* Check the length of the input and print that information back to the user
      * The output should look something like this: 
  * "Your input was: ..."
    * "The input has X characters."

## Word count
* Find and print the word count of the input, assuming that each space symbol starts a new word.

## Hide letter
* Ask the user to supply one or more letters, then hide all occurances of those letters (e.g. by replacing themn with a * symbol).

## Add a new sentence
* Ask the user to add another sentence and concatenate both user inputs. 
* Re-use the method to hide letters (with the previous input);
